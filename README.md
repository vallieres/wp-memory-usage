Show up the PHP version, memory limit and current memory usage in the dashboard and admin footer

Show up the PHP version, memory limit and current memory usage in the dashboard and admin footer. You can now simple measure the requirements of your plugins and language files. [Here my blog post about the plugin](http://alexrabe.boelinger.com/2009/06/14/dear-hoster-we-need-more-memory/).


This is copied from an existing, non maintained plugin, called [WP Memory Usage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-memory-usage/). It had errors in the Wordpress Error Log that were pissing me off :)
